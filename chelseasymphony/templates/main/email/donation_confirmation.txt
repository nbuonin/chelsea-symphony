Hi {{ first_name }}!

Among the many roles we all play in support of The Chelsea Symphony, I love that itâ€™s my honor to thank you for your ${{ amount }} contribution to TCS.

The backbone of TCS is the commitment of individuals, like you, giving a little bit of themselves to keep the arts alive in America. Your contribution shows me that the spirit of our vision is alive and well.

You probably donated because you know someone involved in TCS or you are a person who supports the things they believe in, like a life with music in it. These are two of the main reasons people tell me when I ask them why they support us. 

At TCS, we believe that the arts belong in our society and that it should be accessible to everyone. We believe music should always be made available to those need it. We do this by supporting a suggested-donation ticket model in addition to ticket sales and through our performances in NYC Department of Correction facilities. We do this by continuing to expand our artistic programming to one of inclusion. We do this by performing great concerts with a volunteer orchestra comprised of musicians in NYC who receive professional development and featured soloist opportunities through their participation. So how do we afford the infrastructure of one of all of this in one of the most expensive cities in the world?

Because of the generosity of people like you.

The Chelsea Symphony is an orchestra that is growing and expanding and you are now a part of it. 

{{ first_name }}, thank you for helping music thrive.
